# Chess Project 2024
By Bryce Tee

# About

**NOTICE** - THE FINAL PROJECT IS LOCATED IN THE Chess FINAL.zip FILE.

This is a java based chess game designed to be played in the terminal by Bryce Tee. Chess is a classic board game played by two players on an 8x8 grid known as a chessboard. Players take turns moving their pieces across the board, following specific movement rules for each type of piece.  There are 6 different types of pieces that function differently from each other in order to recreate a match between the White colored player and the Black colored player. 

# Controls
In order to start the game, you must go to the Main Class file and run the command in which the game will appear in the terminal. Sharing a screen, the players will input their moves through the terminal from the use of the scanner function used by the gamestate class. There should be no other needed files or programs to be downloaded for this project to run.
